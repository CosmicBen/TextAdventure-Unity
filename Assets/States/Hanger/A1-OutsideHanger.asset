  storyText: 'Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.

    At
    least 10 of them are guarding the hanger door.

    Typical.


    I could try
    punching my through, or sneaking through the long way to the emergency exit.


    What
    should I do?


    1.) Take them head on - rush the 10 guards.

    2.) Sneak
    my way through to the emergency exit.'
