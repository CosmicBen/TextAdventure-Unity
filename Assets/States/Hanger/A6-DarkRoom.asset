    off and the door opened. Thank goodness for the Pumping Station being so loud.

    in a dark room. You hear people yelling over the top of the combustion boilers.
    You catch some words. THUNK, THUNK, "shut off the values...", THUNK, THUNK "...
    get out in time?", THUNK, THUNK, "... massive pressure", THUNK, THUNK, "... for
    glory...", THUNK, THUNK...
