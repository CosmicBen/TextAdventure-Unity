  storyText: 'You slink through the machinery towards 2 skanky looking men. The tall,
    scrawny one is carrying an oversized gas-canister-powered arrow shooter, while
    the shorter dumpy man has strapped to him at least a dozen small glass bottles
    with gray liquid inside.


    The stout fellow finishes cranking a large valve
    (clockwize you notice) and then both men dash off with much haste.


    What
    to do?


    1.) Quick, uncrank that valve, they were clearly up to no good.

    2.)
    Chase the men.'
